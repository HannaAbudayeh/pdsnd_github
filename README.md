The goal of the project is to analyze and compute descriptive statistics about bikeshare usage,
 and to build an interactive Command-Line Interface (CLI) program for users to explore the data.

## Features
Import and filter bikeshare data by city, month, and weekday.
Compute and display descriptive statistics such as:
Most common travel times.
Most popular stations and trips.
Trip durations and user demographics.
Provide an interactive user experience to explore raw data with options to sort data by columns in ascending or descending order.
